# Agosto - Final Project
_Final Project for LIS 5937: Introduction to Python_

Hello! This is my final project for LIS 5937: Introduction to Python. I struggled with using Python throughout the semester, so this project was a bit of a challenge for me. There was plenty of frustration during this process, but the project did help improve my understanding of Python and for that I am grateful.  

After looking at the Rock, Paper, Scissors examples provided on Canvas, I decided I wanted to do a game simulation. I initially started with Tic Tac Toe as my game but got frustrated creating the board. I became so flustered that I ended up switching games, which is how I ended up creating a code for Guess the Number. I switched over to Guess the Number mainly because I remember I read about some random number generator for one of our prior assignments. Ideally, I wanted to create a code that did not shut down when something was incorrectly typed or inputted. I also just wanted to create a code that would work, since I could not get some codes in the prior assignments to work. I think I was able to complete my goals for this project â€“ of course, I welcome any feedback stating the contrary. I appreciate Dr. Friedman providing suggestions on my code when I got stuck.  

In terms of methodology, I created this project mainly through trial and error. I often would type in lines for my code and would receive error messages. I also struggled with getting the code to simulate. I ended up watching several YouTube videos and visiting different resources to figure it out. I also, as mentioned above, reached out to Dr. Friedman towards the end of my project for help.
